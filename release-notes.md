# Release notes

## 1.8
See [log](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/compare/1.7...1.8).

For players:
* Mods will no longer generate `.cache` subfolders.
* Fixed multiple issues where mods failed during assembly loading.
* Tweaked install package to reduce confusion.

For mod developers:
* You can now create a `SemanticVersion` from a version string.
* **Warning:** `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location` will no longer return a valid path,
  because mod assemblies are now loaded from memory. This has been strongly discouraged since
  SMAPI 1.3 (which sometimes loaded DLLs from a `.cache` subfolder).

For SMAPI developers:
* Rewrote assembly loading from the ground up. The new implementation...
  * is much simpler;
  * eliminates the `.cache` folders by loading assemblies from memory;
  * ensures DLLs are loaded in leaf-to-root order;
  * improves dependent assembly resolution;
  * reduces log verbosity.

## 1.7
See [log](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/compare/1.6...1.7).

For players:
* The console now shows the folder path where mods should be added.
* The console now shows deprecation warnings after the list of loaded mods (instead of intermingled).

For mod developers:
* Added a mod registry which provides metadata about loaded mods.
* The `Entry(…)` method is now deferred until all mods are loaded.
* Fixed `SaveEvents.BeforeSave` and `.AfterSave` not triggering on days when the player shipped something.
* Fixed `PlayerEvents.LoadedGame` and `SaveEvents.AfterLoad` being fired before the world finishes initialising.
* Fixed some `LocationEvents`, `PlayerEvents`, and `TimeEvents` being fired during game startup.
* Increased deprecation levels for `SObject`, `LogWriter` (not `Log`), and `Mod.Entry(ModHelper)` (not `Mod.Entry(IModHelper)`) to _pending removal_. Increased deprecation levels for `Mod.PerSaveConfigFolder`, `Mod.PerSaveConfigPath`, and `Version.VersionString` to _info_.

## 1.6
See [log](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/compare/1.5...1.6).

For players:
* Added console commands to open the game/data folders.
* Updated list of incompatible mods.
* Fixed `config.json` values being duplicated in some cases.
* Fixed some Linux users not being able to launch SMAPI from Steam.
* Fixed the installer not finding custom install paths on 32-bit Windows.
* Fixed error when loading a mod which was released with a `.cache` folder for a different platform.
* Fixed error when the console doesn't support colour.
* Fixed error when a mod reads a custom JSON file from a directory that doesn't exist.

For mod developers:
* Added three events: `SaveEvents.BeforeSave`, `SaveEvents.AfterSave`, and `SaveEvents.AfterLoad`.
* Deprecated three events:
  * `TimeEvents.OnNewDay` is unreliable; use `TimeEvents.DayOfMonthChanged` or `SaveEvents` instead.
  * `PlayerEvents.LoadedGame` is replaced by `SaveEvents.AfterLoad`.
  * `PlayerEvents.FarmerChanged` serves no purpose.

For SMAPI developers:
  * Added support for specifying a lower bound in mod incompatibility data.
  * Added support for custom incompatible-mod error text.
  * Fixed issue where `TrainerMod` used older logic to detect the game path.

## 1.5
See [log](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/compare/1.4...1.5).

For players:
  * Added an option to disable update checks.
  * SMAPI will now show a friendly error with update links when you try to use a known incompatible mod version.
  * Fixed an error when a mod uses the new reflection API on a missing field or method.
  * Fixed an issue where mods weren't notified of a menu change if it changed while SMAPI was still notifying mods of the previous change.

For developers:
  * Deprecated `Version` in favour of `SemanticVersion`.  
    _This new implementation is [semver 2.0](http://semver.org/)-compliant, introduces `NewerThan(version)` and `OlderThan(version)` convenience methods, adds support for parsing a version string into a `SemanticVersion`, and fixes various bugs with the former implementation. This also replaces `Manifest` with `IManifest`._
  * Increased deprecation levels for `SObject`, `Extensions`, `LogWriter` (not `Log`), `SPlayer`, and `Mod.Entry(ModHelper)` (not `Mod.Entry(IModHelper)`).

## 1.4
See [log](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/compare/1.3...1.4).

For players:
  * SMAPI will now prevent mods from crashing your game with menu errors.
  * The installer will now automatically detect most custom install paths.
  * The installer will now automatically clean up old SMAPI files.
  * Each mod now has its own `.cache` folder, so removing the mod won't leave orphaned cache files behind.
  * Improved installer wording to reduce confusion.
  * Fixed the installer not removing TrainerMod from appdata if it's already in the game mods directory.
  * Fixed the installer not moving mods out of appdata if the game isn't installed on the same Windows partition.
  * Fixed the SMAPI console not being shown on Linux and Mac.

For developers:
  * Added a reflection API (via `helper.Reflection`) that simplifies robust access to the game's private fields and methods.
  * Added a searchable `list_items` console command to replace the `out_items`, `out_melee`, and `out_rings` commands.
  * Added `TypeLoadException` details when intercepted by SMAPI.
  * Fixed an issue where you couldn't debug into an assembly because it was copied into the `.cache` directory. That will now only happen if necessary.

## 1.3
See [log](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/compare/1.2...1.3).

For players:
  * You can now run most mods on any platform (e.g. run Windows mods on Linux/Mac).
  * Fixed the normal uninstaller not removing files added by the 'SMAPI for developers' installer.

## 1.2
See [log](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/compare/1.1.1...1.2).

For players:
  * Fixed compatibility with some older mods.
  * Fixed mod errors in most event handlers crashing the game.
  * Fixed mod errors in some event handlers preventing other mods from receiving the same event.
  * Fixed game crashing on startup with an audio error for some players.

For developers:
  * Improved logging to show `ReflectionTypeLoadException` details when it's caught by SMAPI.

## 1.1
See [log](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/compare/1.0...1.1.1).

For players:
  * Fixed console exiting immediately when some exceptions occur.
  * Fixed an error in 1.0 when mod uses `config.json` but the file doesn't exist.
  * Fixed critical errors being saved to a separate log file.
  * Fixed compatibility with some older mods.<sup>1.1.1</sup>
  * Fixed race condition where some mods would sometimes crash because the game wasn't ready yet.<sup>1.1.1</sup>

For developers:
  * Added new logging interface:
    * easier to use;
    * supports trace logs (written to the log file, but hidden in the console by default);
    * messages are now listed in order;
    * messages now show which mod logged them;
    * more consistent and intuitive console color scheme.
  * Added optional `MinimumApiVersion` to `manifest.json`.
  * Added emergency interrupt feature for dangerous mods.
  * Fixed deprecation warnings being repeated if the mod can't be identified.<sup>1.1.1</sup>
